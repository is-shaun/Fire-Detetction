## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for detecting forest fires using image classification techniques. The model is developed using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on a dataset containing fire and non-fire images. The notebook is designed to be executed in Google Colab for ease of use and reproducibility.

## Features
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance.
- Training, validation, and testing pipeline with performance evaluation.
- Visualization of training metrics and model predictions.
- Can be extended to real-time fire detection applications.
